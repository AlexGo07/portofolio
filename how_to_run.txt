# How to Run Your Portfolio Website

To run your portfolio website locally and eventually deploy it to GitHub, follow these steps:

### Running Locally

Running Your Portfolio Website Locally:

1. Complete file structure setup:
   - Make sure all your files (HTML, CSS, JS) are in the correct folders
   - Create an 'img' folder and add these images:
     * profile.jpg - Your profile picture
     * hero-bg.jpg - Background image for the hero section
     * project1.jpg, project2.jpg, project3.jpg - Project images

2. Open the index.html file:
   - Double-click the index.html file to open it in your default web browser
   - OR right-click the file and select "Open with" and choose your preferred browser

3. For live preview with automatic updates (optional):
   - Install Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Install the "Live Server" extension
   - Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server"

4. Making changes:
   - Edit the index.html file to customize your content
   - Modify styles.css to change the appearance
   - Update main.js for any JavaScript functionality changes
   - After each change, save the file and refresh your browser

5. Testing responsiveness:
   - Use your browser's developer tools (F12 or Right-click > Inspect)
   - Click the device toggle button (mobile icon) to see how it looks on different devices
   - Test different screen sizes by resizing the viewport
